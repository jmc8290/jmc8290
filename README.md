### Hi there ğŸ‘‹
I'm James! I'm currently a student at BYU majoring in Statistics with minors in Computer Science and Mathematics. I like to analyze data to learn about the not-so easy to see trends. I like various types of puzzles and languages. 
TakoÄ‘er, govorim naÅ¡ jezik da me cijeli svijet razumije ;)
